## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The way that I make sure that my program is functional is by referring to the requirements for the project. There are certain things that the program is expected to do. If the program fails to meet the requirements, then it has failed to meet the standards set by the client. I also make sure that the program is functional by conducting testing and looking for bugs and errors. Security is its own beast. I first look over my code and make sure that it is following secure coding practices. After an initial review I run a dependency check to check for known security vulnerabilities. Finally, I may run further checks and tests on a test environment before it is running out in the wild.
    
## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs can be hard to pinpoint for both the developer and the client. One way that I try to get user needs and requirements is by asking open-ended questions and asking them what they want the program to do. I will then break down the requirements into functional and non-functional. From there I can develop a plan to code and test the requirements using an agile methodology. If there is any gray area or uncertainty, then I ask the client to clarify.
    
## How do I approach designing software?
The first thing I do is identify what the program needs to do. Then I start to planning on how to Implement it. After some initial planning I try to create the minimum viable product. This means I want to make a program that meets the minimum requirements. I test my code and look for errors every few lines. It is possible to make a program that may be tested with the use of placeholder methods and classes. I tag these placeholders and go back to finalize them. Once I have everything in place I try to go back and look for any edits or revisions.
